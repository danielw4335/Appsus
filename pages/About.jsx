            <h1>About Appsus</h1>
            <p>
                Appsus is a productivity web application inspired by Google Workspace tools like Gmail and Google Keep.
                It was built as part of a Fullstack development course using modern technologies such as React, Node.js, and CSS3.
                The platform focuses on simplicity, responsive design, and modular components â€“ allowing users to manage emails and notes in one place.
                Appsus was developed with best practices in mind: routing, state management, reusable components, and real-world app structure.

                            I'm Daniel wallache, a 24-year-old Fullstack Development student from the Lachish region, currently studying at Coding Academy.
                            I'm gaining hands-on experience with modern technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and responsive design.
                            The course is highly practical, project-driven, and focuses on building real-world applications from frontend to backend.
                            I'm passionate about technology, creative problem-solving, and eager to keep growing as a developer.
